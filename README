Paws-Bazaar is an online marketplace that helps people find everything they need for their furry friends.  We sell pet food, toys, clothes, personal pet-homes, and everything in between.  In addition, we provide an on-line review system so that our customers can share thoughts on our products and hone in on exactly what they are looking for.

Our focus is on pet owners who aren’t afraid to spend a little extra on their loved ones to provide them with a wide variety of high-quality products available in a simple to use online interface.  Because we don’t have a brick-n-mortar storefront, our online store has advanced features that allow our customers to easily sort/filter our catalogue based on item, price, and customer reviews.

Paws-Bazaar makes it easy to purchase items through their streamlined checkout system which includes multiple shipping options, payment options, and confirmation notification on checkout.  We strive to provide excellent customer service to those who love their animals as much as we do!
